## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Deploy Firebase Functions**

1. **Install dependencies and deploy:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to functions directory
   cd functions
   
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Deploy functions
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

2. **No email configuration needed!**
   - Firebase handles email sending automatically
   - Uses Firebase's built-in email templates
   - No Gmail setup or app passwords required

### **Step 2: Test the Verification Flow**

1. **Test with a new user account:**
   - Create a new user account
   - Check email for verification link
   - Click the link to verify
   - Test login after verification

2. **That's it!** No additional setup required.

## 🚀 How It Works

### **User Registration Flow**
1. User creates account (owner or employee)
2. Firebase Function creates user with `emailVerified: false`
3. Verification email automatically sent with token
4. User cannot log in until email is verified

### **Email Verification Flow**
1. User receives verification email with simple link
2. Clicking link directly verifies the email
3. User sees success message in browser
4. User metadata updated to `emailVerified: true`
5. User can now log in successfully

### **Login Flow with Verification**
1. User attempts to log in
2. System checks `emailVerified` status
3. If unverified, shows verification options
4. User can resend verification or verify manually
5. Once verified, login proceeds normally
