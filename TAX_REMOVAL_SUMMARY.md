# Tax Removal Summary

## Issue
The app has no tax provision, but tax calculations were still being performed and displayed in the sales summaries.

## Requirement
Since there's no tax provision in the app, tax should always be 0 in all calculations and displays.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Print Summary Calculation (`doPrintSummary`)

**Before:**
```typescript
const tax = dateFilteredReceipts.reduce((sum, r) => sum + (r.tax || 0), 0);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const tax = 0; // No tax provision in the app
```

### 2. Excel Export Calculation

**Before:**
```typescript
const totalTax = data.transactions.reduce((sum, t) => sum + (t.tax || 0), 0);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const totalTax = 0; // No tax provision in the app
```

### 3. Print Format Display

**Added Tax line to show 0.0:**
- **Fallback Print**: Added `Tax                0.0`
- **Bluetooth Print**: Added `Tax                   0.0`

### 4. Excel Export Display

**Added Tax line to show 0.0:**
```typescript
lines.push(`Tax,${totalTax.toFixed(1)}`);
```

## Files Modified

## Updated Sales Summary Format

### Print Format:
```
--- Sales Summary ---
Gross Sales        [Amount]
Tax                0.0
Service Charge     [Amount]
Discounts          [Amount]
Complementary      0.0
Net Sales          [Amount]
```

### Excel Format:
```
--- Sales Summary ---
Gross Sales,[Amount]
Tax,0.0
Service Charge,[Amount]
Discounts,[Amount]
Complementary,0.0
Net Sales,[Amount]
```

## Updated Calculation Formula

### Net Sales Calculation:
**Before:** `Gross Sales - Discounts + Tax + Service Charge`
**After:** `Gross Sales - Discounts + 0 + Service Charge`

### Simplified Formula:
**Net Sales = Gross Sales - Discounts + Service Charge**

## Example Calculation

### Sample Data:
- Gross Sales: 300
- Total Discounts: 30
- Tax: 0 (no tax provision)
- Service Charge: 15

### Result:
- **Net Sales = 300 - 30 + 0 + 15 = 285**

## Result

✅ **Tax Removed** - All tax calculations set to 0
✅ **Display Updated** - Tax line shows 0.0 in all formats
✅ **Calculation Fixed** - Net sales calculation updated
✅ **Consistent Format** - Both print and Excel show tax as 0
✅ **Test Updated** - Test data reflects no tax provision

The tax provision has been completely removed from the app, and all sales summaries now correctly show tax as 0.0.
