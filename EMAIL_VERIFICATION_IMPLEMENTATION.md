# Email Verification Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds **mandatory email verification** to the POS application. Users must verify their email address before they can log in and access any features of the app.

## Key Features

### ✅ **Mandatory Verification**
- Users **cannot log in** without email verification
- Automatic email sending when verification is required
- Clear error messages and user guidance

### ✅ **Professional UI**
- Beautiful dialog box with clear instructions
- Email app integration for easy access
- Resend functionality with rate limiting
- Retry login option after verification

### ✅ **Security**
- Immediate sign-out if email is not verified
- Rate limiting on verification email resends
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## How It Works

### 1. **Login Attempt**
When a user tries to log in:
```typescript
// User enters credentials and clicks "Sign In"
const userMetadata = await authService.signIn(email, password);
```

### 2. **Verification Check**
The system checks if the email is verified:
```typescript
if (!user.emailVerified) {
  // Sign out immediately
  await signOut(auth);
  
  // Send verification email
  await sendEmailVerification(user);
  
  // Throw specific error
  throw new Error('EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED');
}
```

### 3. **Dialog Display**
If verification is required, a dialog appears with:
- Clear explanation of what's needed
- User's email address
- Step-by-step instructions
- Options to resend email or retry login

### 4. **User Actions**
Users can:
- **Open Email App**: Direct access to their email client
- **Resend Email**: Request a new verification email (rate limited)
- **Retry Login**: Try logging in again after verification
- **Cancel**: Close the dialog and try later

## Testing

To test the email verification flow:

1. **Create a new account** with an unverified email
2. **Try to log in** → Should see verification dialog
3. **Check email** → Should receive verification email
4. **Click verification link** → Email should be verified
5. **Return to app** → Click "I've Verified - Try Login Again"
6. **Login should succeed** → Access granted

## Configuration

The email verification system uses Firebase's built-in email verification:
- **Provider**: Firebase Authentication
- **Template**: Firebase default (can be customized in Firebase Console)
- **Rate Limiting**: 1 minute between resends (configurable)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- SMS verification as backup
- Admin panel for verification management
- Bulk verification for existing users
- Analytics on verification rates
